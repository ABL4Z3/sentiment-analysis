# Sentiment Analysis Tool ðŸ“Š

A simple and interactive web application built with Streamlit for analyzing the sentiment of text input. The tool classifies each sentence as Positive, Negative, or Neutral, providing a summary with metrics, a visual bar chart, and a detailed sentence-by-sentence breakdown.

## Features

- **Text Input**: Paste or type text to analyze.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Uses TextBlob to classify sentences based on polarity (Positive, Negative, Neutral).
- **Summary Metrics**: Displays total sentences and percentages for each sentiment category.
- **Visual Chart**: Bar chart showing sentiment distribution using Matplotlib.
- **Detailed Table**: Pandas DataFrame with sentence-level analysis including polarity scores.
- **NLTK Integration**: Automatically downloads and uses NLTK's punkt tokenizer for sentence splitting.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Streamlit for an easy-to-use web interface.
